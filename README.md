### LogsTF <a href="https://sourcemod.krus.dk/logstf.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-download-informational" /></a> <a href="./logstf"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-More%20info-yellowgreen" /></a>

- **Note:** Requires the [SteamWorks](https://users.alliedmods.net/~kyles/builds/SteamWorks/) ([mirror](https://github.com/hexa-core-eu/SteamWorks/releases)) extension
- Automatically uploads logs to logs.tf
- Set cvar **logstf_apikey** to your Logs.tf API Key
- You can see the logs in-game by typing `!logs` or `.ss`
- Uploads logs after each round (the log will be updated on logs.tf after each round), so you can use `!logs`/`.ss` after each round
- Fixes several bugs seen in other plugins (including the last round missing, and stats being wrong when you play two matches on the same map)

### Pause <a href="https://sourcemod.krus.dk/pause.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-download-informational" /></a> <a href="./pause"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-More%20info-yellowgreen" /></a>

- Shows pause information in chat (see [screenshot](https://sourcemod.krus.dk/pause.jpg) and [screenshot](https://sourcemod.krus.dk/pause-time.jpg))
- Use **repause** command to quickly unpause and pause (when someone is trying to rejoin during a pause)
- Adds a 5 second countdown when unpausing
- Allows everyone to chat as much as they want during the pause
- Unpause protection (if two people write pause at the same time, it doesn't accidentally unpause)
- Restores uber percentages when unpausing

### ClassWarning <a href="https://sourcemod.krus.dk/classwarning.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-download-informational" /></a>

- In ETF2L, class limits are not enforced by the server. This plugin warns players in chat if they are breaking the class limit (see [screenshot](https://sourcemod.krus.dk/classwarning.jpg)).

### RecordSTV <a href="https://sourcemod.krus.dk/recordstv.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-download-informational" /></a>

- When a match starts, it starts recording a STV demo
- When the match ends, it stops the recording
- Set up the path and the filenames of the demos with cvars: **recordstv_path** and **recordstv_filename**
- In both cvars you can use several placeholders. See the description of recordstv_filename for the full list of placeholders.

### WaitForSTV <a href="https://sourcemod.krus.dk/waitforstv.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-download-informational" /></a>

- Waits up to 90 seconds when changing map
- Doesn't wait more time than necessary

### AFK <a href="https://sourcemod.krus.dk/afk.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-download-informational" /></a>

- If a player is AFK in warmup, it shows [a warning](https://sourcemod.krus.dk/afk-1.jpg) to all players on their team
- If both teams ready up and there is an AFK player, it shows [a warning](https://sourcemod.krus.dk/afk-2.jpg) to the person's team
- Works together with TF2DM... if a player is AFK, he will be moved back to spawn

### RestoreScore <a href="https://sourcemod.krus.dk/restorescore.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-download-informational" /></a>

- Restores a player's score on the scoreboard when he reconnects
